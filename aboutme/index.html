            <p>
                Hello, my name is Ethan Nielsen. This is my second semester at BYUi.<br>
                I am not married and don't plan to be any time soon. Right now, I <br>
                do IT work for an insurance company in California. The reason why I <br>
                enjoy BYUi is because of the people here. My degree is Comp. Science <br>
                and I hope to become a full stack dev 2 right out of college. I hope <br>
                to be able to get all of the knoledge I need to be successful in the <br>
                work place as a software engineer. <br>
                <br>
                    I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ for my entire <br>
                    life. My favorite quote comes from jacob 6:12: <br><br>
                    "O be wise, what can I say more".<br><br>
                    This was on my missionary plack. I served in Atlanta Georgia.<br>
                    Thanks for the opportunity of this class!
